## Building
This component can be compiled using Gambas 3.13 or newer.

This component is *not* designed to support Cygwin compilation and may perform poorly or incorrectly on alternate Operating Systems.

## Documentation
Gambas does not natively provide a Checked Listbox control. This component adds a nearly exact clone of the ListBox control, but with checkboxes for each row, a Checked event, and a minor visual focus cue in the form of a dotted selection border.
